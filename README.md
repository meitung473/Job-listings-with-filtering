## Overview
Hi, I am Rosa Hong.
I build this project with React class component + Sass + Webpack5 + Flow-type.
This is my first time using Flow.js to check type.
I know that using TypeScript is more common in a modern project. 
Just for my first approach to the type checker, I choose Flow-type.
TypeScript will be my goal for the next project.

I have learned React in an online course for six months.
I spent most of my time on JavaScript fundamentalsðŸ¥².
Web tech changes too fast to learn at first. 

Any feedback for me, I would apperciate you.
